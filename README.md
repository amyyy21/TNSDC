### What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli.Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications or conditions such as autoimmune diseases.Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke and a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis.The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The project is centered around harnessing the capabilities of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This initiative aims to aid healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia, thereby improving patient outcomes. By utilizing CNNs and image processing techniques, the system can analyze chest X-ray images and accurately identify signs of pneumonia. This approach enables rapid and automated screening of patients, potentially reducing diagnosis time and improving overall healthcare efficiency. With the increasing demand for reliable and efficient medical diagnostics, leveraging CNNs for pneumonia detection represents a significant step forward in enhancing healthcare services.
